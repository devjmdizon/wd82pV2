    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>
      Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings
    </p>

    <h3>Lists</h3>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Inline Elements</h3>
    <em>Emphasis</em>
    <em>Italic</em>
    <p>
      <em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word. or
      praise
    </p>
    <p>
      Other time you need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize the importance
      of a word or phrase
    </p>

    <h3>Empty Elements</h3>
    <p>Thanks for reading! HTML, should be easier now</p>
